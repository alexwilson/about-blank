# antoligy/about-blank #

A Google Chrome extension to use [about-blank](https://ax.gy/about-blank) as the new tab page.

As about:blank utilises an offline-first caching pattern with service-workers, this is safe and
will work offline.

### WARNING ###
This is very much a work in progress, I will add more thorough documentation
on building and testing this prior to publishing on the Chrome app store.
